Lab activity:
1. Make a simple Java Project in Eclipse
2. get starter sqlite project from github
3. run code and observe compile fail due to jdk javac not having access to the sqlite JDBC driver
4. get sqlite jar file from moodle
5. add that jar file to your Java Eclipse project
6. goal = run starter code and observe correct operation because Java compiler can now access the sqlite JDBC driver files

next steps:
We can do SQL stuff from inside Java Program space

1. Create databases
2. put in data
3. query the data: get the Result Set from a SQL STATEMENT: the jdbc driver will send back to us a RESULT SET: which will be a Java Collection Object
we can parse over that object
we can pluck off the ROWSETS returned from our SQL call to DB

take RS from DATA PULL : wrap it up in html and push it back to the client browser via the HTTP server we are running our controller code


activity: write a sql statement to enroll Mary into Java

do this NOW. 1 minute.

insert into enrollments (studentid, classid)
values (2,1)

activity: generate student schedules:

select students.studentid, students.studentname,
classes.classname, classes.classtime, classes.roomid 
from students, classes, enrollments 
where students.studentid = enrollments.studentid 
an    classes.classid = enrollments.classid
